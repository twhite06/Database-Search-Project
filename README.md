Purpose:  

        Databases can be useful in manu ways. They have an organizational aspect to them which does give them much of their popularity, but most importantly they help to solve the problem of excessive research time. This program is a database modeled off of Genes. Each attached document is an example list of theoretical Genes and their mutations. This program makes it possible to access data grouped in the manner described above for several purposes.
